    <h2>About the webpage</h2>
    <p>Time Explorer is a fun interactive game that explores Queenslands rich history.</p>
    <p>The website is designed for children between 8 - 12 years old. We believe that many kids see history as a boring subject and therefore have no interest in learning more about it. We are attempting to address this issue through a website that focuses heavily on user interaction and feedback.</p>
